<div class="paragraph">Sea birds tend to eat plastic debris that float on top of the ocean surface, which are generally not even partially degraded. The birds end up ingesting and choke on the plastics, and later dying from infection and/or entanglement. Floating plastic pieces also block the ability for marine and floral life in the ocean to receive the sunlight they need to survive. With the biodegradable plastic, not only can seabirds digest the plastic debris but it is unlikely that plastic debris large enough to harm the seabirds would be abundant enough&nbsp;to be eaten. The plastic dissolves very quickly eliminating a large portion of that risk. The quickly degrading plastic also wouldn't be able to block any sunlight as the pieces would be much too small or simply already completely dissolved.<br /><br />In order to make our plastic an effective product we need to think ahead to industrial procedures. The model to the right shows a prototype for extracting starch. The Primary compartment uses a brush-less motor attacked to a terminal with several blades. This is used to breakdown the source of starch, this starch is then moved down through a funnel, and eventually reaches a reservoir where it can be used for plastic creation.<br /><br /></div>

<div class="paragraph"><br /><span style="color:rgb(37, 37, 37)">The bio plastic&nbsp;can be used for a wide variety of products as it can be substituted for almost any mainstream plastic. With slight differences in the composition of the plastic, it could be more effective for different uses or fields of application as well. For example, adding more glycerin to the plastic will allow it to be more flexible and be used for items such as plastic bags or packaging. Reducing the glycerin content would be useful for things such as utensils, to credit cards, to even construction and housing.&nbsp;If integrated into a 3D printer filament, people could even use the bio plastic to produce a variety of creative and unique products free of any environmental effects, in their own homes.</span><br /><br /><span style="color:rgb(37, 37, 37)"><span style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0)">Putting our plastic in to use, however, would be difficult to do with the ever increasing demand for plastic products and the growing plastic industry. To allow for our plastic to replace conventional plastics, we will need a method of production efficient enough to be widely available.&nbsp;</span><span style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0)">The industrialization of our plastic is key for us to strive in the open market. To do this, a simple assembly line would help the most.&nbsp;</span></span><span style="color:rgb(37, 37, 37)">The base ingredient, being cornstarch instead of a complex polymer, also makes it more cost efficient to produce and manufacture in factories. Also, because of the simplicity of starch, many different forms of starches extracted from different plants could be used to achieve the same results. Currently, we have done testing of the plastic composed of potato starch showed that we are not limited to cornstarch, as the potato starch based plastic yielded nearly identical results to the corn starch bases plastic. We believe that the only differences is test results is due to slight inconsistency of our production, which won't be a problem though in factory production as every production batch would be identical and consistent. The use of other starches would also be useful on the global scale, as other areas of the world may not have access to a specific starch due to agricultural differences. Different starches yielding the same results means that our plastic could be implemented world wide to fix this world wide problem.</span><span style="color:rgb(37, 37, 37)"><span style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0)">&nbsp;The use of different starches would also help to eliminate the cost problem, as producing our plastic currently costs about 5 times as much as producing a conventional plastic.</span><font color="#000000">&nbsp;We have designed a machine however, which would allow us to extract starch from wasted sources, such as potato skins in restaurants. Our machine can extract a pure enough form of the starch to create our bio plastic. This would cut costs as acquiring these starches would mean picking up wasted sources from other establishments.&nbsp; &nbsp;</font></span><br /><br /><font color="#000000">We believe that a rise in the use of bio plastics&nbsp;will not only guarantee a better future for our oceans, but also has a chance of becoming the future of plastic manufacturing. Replacing all conventional plastic manufacturing with bio plastics would halt the damage done to the environment, and save countless ecosystems from imminent&nbsp;doom.&nbsp;</font></div>
